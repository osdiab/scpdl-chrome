        <h1>To download videos, run this in your terminal.</h1>
        <p>It will download every file and name them according to the date of
        the lecture. So, go to the folder you want them to be downloaded to,
        and run the below code. You probably should copy this into a file and
        run the script that way, rather than pasting this directly in. It will
        make it much easier to cancel the job if you must.</p>
        <p>Note: This script depends on wget. So download it!</p>
